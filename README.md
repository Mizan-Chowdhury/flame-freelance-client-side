## Some Features of my project
* My website homepage has a navbar, banner, footer and some important sections. I have added many routes relevant to my website apart from home page. And kept those routes as private routes. If a user is not logged in and wants to access those routes, the page will redirect him to the login page.

* If the user has not registered on our page before then he can go to the register route by toggling from the login route. If the user enters less than six passwords or does not enter an uppercase or special character in the password, an error message will be displayed on the page.And a sweet alert will show on the page when the user completes the registration or login correctly.

* When the user completes the registration or login, his name and picture will be shown in the navbar. And he can go to private routes.

* Users can see three types of jobs on this website. And he/she can bid the price and date according to his demand.

* And after doing his bid, the bid request will go to the recruiter of that job. And then the recruiter can manage
the user who bids on his job post.

* Also, users can post jobs as a recruiter on this website.
